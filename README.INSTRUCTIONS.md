# Take-Home Problem  

## Objective  

Develop a Python web application that leverages AI to summarize text documents.  

## Problem Statement  

Create a Python web application with an upload endpoint that allows users to submit text documents. The application should use a Large Language Model (LLM) such as GPT-4, facilitated by LangChain and OpenAI, to generate and return a summary of the uploaded document. The summary should be concise, coherent, and capture the main points of the text, regardless of the document's length or topic.  

## Requirements  

- Utilize Python and a backend framework (e.g., Flask, Django, FastAPI) to create an upload endpoint.  
- Integrate LangChain and OpenAI's GPT-4 for text summarization.  
- The application should accept a `.txt` file as input and return the summary as a response to the upload request.  
- Implement error handling to manage potential issues with file uploads, API limits, and other exceptions.  
- Write a README file documenting how to set up, run the application, and interact with the upload endpoint.  
- Ensure the application is deployable, with instructions included in the README.  

## Evaluation Criteria  

- Code quality, readability, and organization.  
- Effective and efficient use of the LLM through LangChain and OpenAI.  
- Robust handling of edge cases, potential errors, and user feedback.  
- Clarity and thoroughness of documentation.  
- Ease of deployment and use.  

## Timeframe  

The task should take approximately 2 to 3 hours to complete. Please submit your solution within 4 days from the date of the interview.  

## Submission  

Provide a link to a public git repository containing all source code and any additional resources required to run the application.  

We are excited to see your innovative approach to this challenge and your ability to create a functional and user-friendly AI-powered application.
